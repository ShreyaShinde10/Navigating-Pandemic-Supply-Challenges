COVID-19 has had a rapid impact on our daily lives, businesses, global trade, and migration, as well as slowing the economy.
Because the virus spreads quickly from person to person, early detection of the sickness is critical for controlling its spread. The vaccine being developed currently can only be stored in glass vials.
Payima Biotec and other similar companies will get pharma vials for Covid-19 vaccines from MediCrystals Co.
They've agreed to supply pharma glass materials for the packaging of two billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines with major pharmaceutical companies.
Every year, MediCrystals produces over 8 billion pharmaceutical glass containers.Due to the sudden spike in demand for such products, there is currently a glass shortage.
Because many of the suppliers are small and regional, MediCrystals must ensure that none of them are experiencing business interruptions as a result of the pandemic.
Manufacturers around the world are suffering financial and operational issues; demand is unpredictable, and shortages and stockouts are a concern.
